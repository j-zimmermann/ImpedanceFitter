"""
Plot the impedance measured with a frequency response analyser.
For that, we first convert the data measured with a MokuGo and
a Rohde&Schwarz oscilloscpe.
Both devices have an input impedance of 1MOhm.
We wanted to measure a 47Ohm resistor.
Thus, we connected a 100Om resistor in series with the 47Ohm resistor.
This needs to be accounted for in the conversion by the `R_device` keyword.
