Fitting
=======

The script will cycle through all files in a selected directory
(unless certain files are excluded or explicitly listed)
and will store the experimental data.
The experimental data can then be fitted to user-defined model.

Formulate the model
-------------------

The ImpedanceFitter parser understands circuits that follow
a simple pattern:

- Elements in series are connected by a `+`.
- Elements in parallel are connected by `parallel(A, B)`.

An example of a circuit could be:

.. code-block:: python

        parallel(R, C) + CPE

This stands for a resistor in parallel with a capacitor that are in series
with a constant phase element (CPE).

Also nested parallels are possible:

.. code-block:: python

        parallel(parallel(L, C), R)

Find all available elements in Section :ref:`elements`
and all available circuits in Section :ref:`circuits`.

You can also use prefixes. This is needed if you want
to combine multiple elements or circuits of the same type.
Otherwise, the parameters cannot be distinguished by LMFIT.

For example:

.. code-block:: python

        parallel(R_f1, C_f1) + parallel(R_f2, C_f2)

Execute the fit
---------------

Using :meth:`impedancefitter.fitter.Fitter.run`, those files can be fitted 
to an equivalent circuit model. 
If there are two models involved that shall be fitted sequentially for each file,
refer to :meth:`impedancefitter.fitter.Fitter.sequential_run`.
This method allows one to communicate inferered parameters to the second model.
In [Sabuncu2012]_, an example of such a sequential procedure has been presented.

Add a custom model
------------------

If you want to add a custom model that cannot be built by the existing
models, you need to follow these steps:

1. Create a new function for this like

   .. code-block:: python

    def example_function(omega, parameterA, parameterB):
        impedance = ...
        return impedance

   The first argument of the function needs to be named `omega` and is 
   the angular frequency!
   The same holds true for elements.
   LMFIT generates the model based on the function arguments and always
   takes the first argument as the independent variable.
   The other parameters are then accessible by their names.

2. Give this model a reference name that does not contain numbers or underscores.
   Link it in :meth:`impedancefitter.utils._model_function` to the function you defined in 
   the previous step. Add the model to :meth:`impedancefitter.utils.available_models`.

3. Add the new parameter names and their corresponding LaTex representation to
   :meth:`impedancefitter.utils.get_labels`.

4. Write a unit test for the model.

5. Use the model.
